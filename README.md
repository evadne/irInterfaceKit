#	IRInterfaceKit

UI Toolkit for Cappuccino.  Requires `CGGeometry+IRAdditions` and optionally `IRDelegation`.  Drop this project into your Cappuccino project as a submodule in Frameworks and say

	@import <IRInterfaceKit/IRInterfaceKit.j>

in your app delegate, or anywhere you’ll use the controls and all will be fine.
